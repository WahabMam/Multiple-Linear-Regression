# Multiple Linear Regression Lab
This repository focuses on multiple linear regression in the context of machine learning. The lab demonstrates key concepts, including:

### Cost Function Calculation: Learn how to calculate the cost function for multiple linear regression.
### Gradient Descent Implementation: Explore the implementation of gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
### Numpy Library Usage: Utilize the powerful Numpy library for efficient numerical operations.

## Previous Lab
Before diving into this repository, it's strongly recommended to check out the Univariate Linear Regression Lab available on my GitHub account. 
This will provide essential background for understanding linear regression with a single feature.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment or any preferred Python environment.
Follow the step-by-step guide to understand and implement multiple linear regression.
